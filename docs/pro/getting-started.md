# Getting Started

PRO version offers unique capabilities, commercial licensing and priority support.
Sales of GoReplay PRO also benefit the community by ensuring that GoReplay itself will remain well supported for the foreseeable future.

## PRO Features

* [AWS S3 output and input](/docs/pro/s3)
* [Custom protocols](/docs/pro/custom-protocols)
* [Accurate TCP sessions](/docs/pro/accurate-tcp-sessions)

## Priority support
Guarantee direct access to the GoReplay experts.
Your subscription gives you priority support for any unforeseen issues and prioritisation of features.

## Commercial friendly license
GoReplay is available under the terms of the GNU LGPLv3 license.
In addition to its useful functionality, buying PRO grants your organization a GoReplay commercial license instead of the GNU LGPL, avoiding any legal issues, and allowing you to freely modify source code, without sharing it back.

See [License details](https://github.com/buger/goreplay/blob/master/COMM-LICENSE)
