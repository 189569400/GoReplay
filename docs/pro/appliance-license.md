# Appliance License

GoReplay can be used as a fully white-label solution to get user HTTP traffic information to your platform.
Essentially, you get a license to modify and distribute GoReplay as you want. From user perspective, such agent can look like as simple as:

```
./acme-agent --api-key <user-key>
```

Or you can hide/distribute it using your packages, service files etc.

GoReplay engine can open new markets for companies specializing on API monitoring and security.
Using GoReplay you do not need to require customers to modify their applications, simplifying the on-boarding experience up to one line.

It also can be helpful in situations when you are dealing with a legacy application and there is no way to modify it, and it is not using API management or similar.

In some configurations, you do not even need to install agent on customer servers to get the data, and instead you can route network traffic to separate machine, and [run agent outside of customer application stack](/docs/guides/network-capture).
